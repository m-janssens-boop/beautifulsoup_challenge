# beautifulsoup_challenge

This project uses BeautifulSoup to scrape two different websites and then uses Pandas to clean and visualize the data.

part_1_mars_news.ipynb uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the mars news website for titles and preview text of all news articles present. 

part_2_mars_weather.ipynb scrapes the table from the mars weather website and compiles it in a Pandas dataframe. It then compares and visualzes different parts of the data in the table. A summary of teh results can be found at the end of the code in the file.
